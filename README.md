# hello-world
Just my humble 'ol hello-world repo 
I've been a computer hobbyist for many years, but am now coming back to it as my main focus after years in medical research & education. I enjoy programming, but I'm most enthusiastic about newtowrk-administration, primarily network-security & pen-testing. 

Oh, & I'm also an amputee cancer survivor, 
So I got that going for me, which is nice...
